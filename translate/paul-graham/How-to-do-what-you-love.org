* How to do what you love
  
To do something well you have to like it. 
어떤 일을 잘 하기 위해서는 먼저 그 일을 좋아해야 한다. 
That idea is not exactly novel.
이 것은 매우 진부한 표현입니다.
We've got it down to four words:"Do what you love." 
우리는 늘 간단히 이렇게 말합니다. "자신이 사랑하는 일을 하세요."
But it's not enough
just to tell people that. Doing what you love is complicated. 
그러나 사람들에게 

The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. 
When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition. 
Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things,
and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted,
and that was called playing.
